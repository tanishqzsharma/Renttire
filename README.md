Renttire -  A web-based application that helps to connect individuals who want to rent their attire to those who are seeking affordable rental options in their local areas.
Many people face the challenge of finding affordable clothing for special events or occasions, which can be a significant financial burden. Additionally, buying expensive outfits that may only be worn once can be wasteful and unsustainable.

We have a landing page where we can see various aesthetics and the clothing range we provide, then we can shop according to the gender by selecting the desired option. You can see the affordable rates at which we can rent the outfits. Coming to the dashboard, we've created a rating system depending upon the experience of person from whom/to whom you lent the clothes, this rating can help you minimise the security deposit in future. Also, we'll be collaborating with several youth oriented brands which will give us discounts on the basis of credits system, credits will be awarded to you whenever you rent something.

Coming to the method of purchasing, we can add any item in the wishlist and directly text the owner of the apparel by using our chat app, they can coordinate and exchange the outfits in whatever way they're comfortable
